      <h2>Muncie Animal Shelter Volunteer Work</h2>
      <p>
        Our active chapter regularly volunteers at the Muncie Animal Shelter,
        assisting with cleaning, organizing supplies, walking dogs, and supporting
        day‑to‑day operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        These visits strengthen our commitment to community engagement and provide
        essential help to an organization that serves hundreds of animals every year.
        Brothers enjoy making a direct impact and giving their time to improve the
        wellbeing of animals in need.

      <h2>Holidays at Gresham</h2>
      <p>
        Holidays at Gresham is an annual drive-through Christmas light experience hosted by
        Meridian Health Services at the Suzanne Gresham Center. Thousands of families attend
        each year to enjoy the festive displays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our brothers volunteer by dressing in holiday-themed outfits and assisting with traffic
        flow, greeting families, and ensuring the event runs smoothly. It is one of our most
        cherished opportunities to give back and bring joy to the Muncie community.
